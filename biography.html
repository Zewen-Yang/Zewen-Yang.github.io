									<h2>Professional Career</h2>
									<p> A fascination with artificial intelligence leads me to a data scientist.
										I was determined to make a difference in the world by using my knowledge and skills to create new technologies that could help people and improve their lives.
									</p>


									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Eduation Path</h2>
									<p> In 2022, I earned my Ph.D. in computer science and control science and engineering. 
										I was under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1HUVcBkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Prof. Sandra Hirche</a> at <a href="https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/itr/home/">the Chair of Information-oriented Control (ITR)</a>, 
										School of Computation, Information and Technology, the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in Germany. 
										I focused on cooperative learning and learning-based control during my time at TUM, 
										and participated in 4 European Notational Research Projects (SeaClear, COVEMAS, 6G-life, REHYB) from 2019 to 2022.
										I supervised 10+ student theses with several projects being graded with the highest score and taught curriculum “Advanced Control and Robot”. 
									</p>
									<p>Before that, from 2017 to 2019, I was supervised by <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37533860900">Prof. Zheping Yan</a> at <a href="http://cisse.hrbeu.edu.cn/jcxszz/hys/jj.htm/">the Institute of Marine Equipment & Control Technology</a>, 
										College of Intelligent Systems Science and Engineering, Harbin Engineering University (HEU), China. 
										I engaged in 2 Notational Research Projects dedicated to underwater vehicles. 
										I also was a principal investigator of “Ph.D. Student Research & Innovation Fund of Fundamental Research Funds” project for multi-robot control.
										After defending my dissertation “Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Formation Cooperative Control in Complex Environment”, 
										I was selected as an outstanding doctoral graduate by HEU. 
										Additionally, I have obtained several honors and scholarships during my Ph.D.
									</p>
									<p> I received a M.Sc. degree in Control Engineering from the College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Northeast Forestry University (NEFU), China, in 2017. 
										At the time of my master's study, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Heming-Jia">Prof. Heming Jia</a> was my supervisor.
										My thesis have been selected by NEFU as an Outstanding Graduate Thesis, 
										“Optimal Control of Miniature Plant Factory Based on Singular Perturbation”. 
										My major ranking is 2nd out of 13 students with several achievements. 
										I served as the director of the Science and Technology Innovation Center Academic Department of NEFU.
									</p>
									<p> I graduated with a B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from the College of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Harbin University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2014. 
										My grade point average was within the top 10% of the class and my thesis was titled “Wind-Solar-Diesel Power Supply Control Strategy”. 
										In our class, I served as the psychological commissioner.

									<h2>Before College</h2>
									<p> I graduated from Harbin No.6 High School before I went to college. 
										This prestigious school has cultivated numerous scientists, engineers, and celebrities since 1924, 
										including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiao_Hong">Xiao Hong</a>, one of the most influential female writers in modern China. 
									</p>
			

									<hr class="major" />
									
									<h2>Childhood</h2>
									<p> I grew up in a loving family, with parents and relatives who always supported and encouraged me. 
										As a child, I was curious and loved to explore the world around me. 
										Whenever I experienced something, I tried to figure out why it happened and to understand how it works. 
										I spent much of my childhood asking questions and striving to make sense of the world.
										As I grew older, my passion for understanding the natural world and creating new technologies only grew stronger. 
										I knew that I wanted to become an inventor and scientist, and worked hard to achieve that goal.
